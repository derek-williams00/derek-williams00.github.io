      "description": "The project started as a database for my CS 340 course. I decided to continue working on it and make it into a full stack web application. The website is a mock online bank website that allows users to create an account, login, and perform basic banking functions. The website is built using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. The website is still a work in progress and I plan to add more features in the future."
