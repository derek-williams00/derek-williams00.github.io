      "description": "The project started as a database for my CS 340 course. I decided to continue working on it and make it into a full stack web application. The website is a mock online bank website that allows users to create an account, login, and perform basic banking functions. The website is built using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. The website is hosted on Heroku and the database is hosted on AWS RDS. The website is still a work in progress and I plan to add more features in the future."
